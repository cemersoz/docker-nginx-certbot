# nginx-certbot-docker
Docker container base image configured with certbot and nginx that automatically gets ssl certificates for domains used by nginx. This repository was originally forked from `@staticfloat` who originally forked it from `@henridwyer`. I'm rewriting the entire codebase since I couldn't get their versions to work for my usecase with my configuration. This repository uses the certbot nginx plugin rather than using the no-plugin version and does not parse the domains from nginx configuration files. Instead, I plan to automatically build nginx configurations from simpler domain jsons
