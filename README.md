# nginx-certbot-docker
Docker container base image configured with certbot and nginx that automatically gets ssl certificates for domains used by nginx. This repository was originally forked from `@staticfloat` who originally forked it from `@henridwyer`. I'm rewriting the entire codebase since I couldn't get their versions to work for my usecase with my configuration
